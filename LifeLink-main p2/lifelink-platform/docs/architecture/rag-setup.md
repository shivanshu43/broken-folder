# LifeLink RAG Setup and Operations

## Boundary

The RAG knowledge store is hosted separately from the Aiven operational PostgreSQL database. The operational database remains authoritative for inventory, request status, donor/recipient records, offers, and facilities. Supabase is used for the vector tables in this initial implementation; the existing private medical-report storage bucket is not used as a general knowledge corpus.

The current RAG allow-list indexes only the reviewed Markdown sources under `docs/knowledge/` and selected internal workflow/SRS documentation. Roles are attached to each source and enforced in vector search. Do not add medical reports, donor/recipient documents, live inventory exports, credentials, or unreviewed uploads to the general FAQ corpus.

## One-time Supabase setup

1. Open the Supabase project dashboard.
2. Open SQL Editor.
3. Run `infra/database/rag-vectors.sql` from this repository.
4. Keep the Aiven `DATABASE_URL` as the operational database connection. Do not use it as the vector-store URL.
5. Create or retain a server-side `.env` in the `lifelink-platform` root. Copy variable names from `.env.example`, and populate `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY` locally. Never commit `.env`; never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for the secret key.

The RAG schema uses 768-dimensional `gemini-embedding-2` vectors. If you change embedding dimensions, alter the pgvector columns/function and rebuild every existing embedding before changing `RAG_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`.

## Index approved documents

From `lifelink-platform`:

```bash
npm run rag:index
```

To process one approved source:

```bash
npm run rag:index -- blood-request-guide
```

Only keys present in `packages/rag/src/knowledge-sources.ts` are accepted. Re-indexing is checksum-aware: unchanged indexed sources are skipped. Source changes cause embeddings to be regenerated and old surplus chunks to be removed.

## Runtime endpoints

All endpoints require an authenticated LifeLink session.

- `POST /api/rag/query`: accepts `{ "message": "...", "history": [] }`.
- `GET /api/rag/sources`: lists indexed sources visible to the current role.
- `POST /api/rag/reindex`: administrator-only maintenance endpoint; accepts an optional approved `sourceKey`.

The assistant can answer documentation questions from indexed sources. Current inventory, facility discovery, and request-status intents use read-only operational queries; state-changing actions are handed back to existing workflows. The assistant does not mutate request or inventory records.

## Security and data freshness

- The Supabase secret key is used only by the API server. It must never be sent to a browser.
- Do not send raw chat messages, passwords, medical details, or tokens to audit logs. The RAG API logs the interaction category and source count, not the full message.
- Live inventory results include their last-updated timestamp. Records older than 24 hours are flagged for confirmation. Facility discovery uses active institution records with usable coordinates; records lacking coordinates cannot be asserted as nearby.
- The current schema has no scheduled blood-donation-camp calendar. The assistant may show registered blood-service facilities but must explicitly say it cannot confirm upcoming camp dates.
- Current implementation notes remove organ transport records/routes even though older SRS language mentions transport. The RAG allow-list therefore includes a warning in the administrator guide and must not promise an organ-transport workflow.
- A RAG answer is not proof of an operational change and cannot be used for clinical, transfusion, donor-eligibility, or final organ-allocation decisions.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

The RAG tests cover intent routing, document chunking, and explicit location extraction. Integration verification of Gemini and Supabase requires the environment variables above and a configured Supabase vector schema.
